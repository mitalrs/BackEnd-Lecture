##Github

####The problem was facing without GitHub:
1. Sharing the code
2. versionig(Controlling the versions it's difficult)
3. Merging code

solution with Github
1. Sharing the code:
  - if two more people want to share there code and collaborate for the project, they will do with GitHub.
  - GitHub stored the code and give the chance to implement this code when they want and give the same authority for all they will have access

2. versionig:
 - If we want to mantain applications with version of code and feature.
 - It's done with github, Github maintain a code with a commits

3. Merging code:
 - If two or more people work on same project we need to marge it and exchange the new changes as well.
 - GitHub also take care of this feature, GitHub maintain the code and allow to get the code in your local and post back.

#### For this feature, GitHub have own rules:
- install Git -> Install my software in your project
- commits -> when your project ready to save make commits for save this perticular project
- push -> after commit and you want to push this code on server for the record make
- pull -> when some one code pushed on Github, you want to update this code in your local to. so, pull it and add your local too.



#### create git repository:
create folder in your local
