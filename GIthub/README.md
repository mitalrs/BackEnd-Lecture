## Github

#### The problem was facing without GitHub:
1. Sharing the code
2. versionig(Controlling the versions it's difficult)
3. Merging code

##### solution with Github
1. **Sharing the code:**
  - if two more people want to share there code and collaborate for the project, they will do with GitHub.
  - GitHub stored the code and give the chance to implement this code when they want and give the same authority for all they will have access

2. **versionig:**
 - If we want to mantain applications with version of code and feature.
 - It's done with github, Github maintain a code with a commits

3. **Merging code:**
 - If two or more people work on same project we need to marge it and exchange the new changes as well.
 - GitHub also take care of this feature, GitHub maintain the code and allow to get the code in your local and post back.

#### For this feature, GitHub have own rules:
- install Git -> Install my software in your project
- commits -> when your project ready to save make commits for save this perticular project
- push -> after commit and you want to push this code on server for the record make
- pull -> when some one code pushed on Github, you want to update this code in your local to. so, pull it and add your local too.



#### git commands:
1. 

2. inialize for git folder with the this command: this command created a folder that's a created by git by default
    > git init
    
3. git commit -a. Commit a snapshot of all changes in the working directory.
       > git commit
   - A shortcut command that immediately creates a commit with a passed commit message.
       >  git commit -m "commit message"

4. displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.
    > git status

5. Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
    > git diff

6. adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. 
    > git add .

7. You typically configure your global username and email address after installing Git.
   - Set your username
       > git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
   - Set your email address
       > git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"
