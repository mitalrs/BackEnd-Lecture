##Github

####The problem was facing without GitHub:
1. Sharing the code
2. versionig(Controlling the versions it's difficult)
3. Merging code

solution with Github
1. Sharing the code:
  - if two more people want to share there code and collaborate for the project, they will do with GitHub.
  - GitHub stored the code and give the chance to implement this code when they want and give the same authority for all they will have access

2. versionig:
 - If we want to mantain applications with version of code and feature.
 - It's done with github, Github maintain a code with a commits

3. Merging code:
 - If two or more people work on same project we need to marge it and exchange the new changes as well.
 - GitHub also take care of this feature, GitHub maintain the code and allow to get the code in your local and post back.
